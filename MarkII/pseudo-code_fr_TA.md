## To Grader,

I know the file isnt complete but I aim to complete everything by monday. Unfortuantely thats the best I can do at the moment. I will try my best not to let this happen again in the future. 

I am still learning to manage my time and learn how to code and do the homework all at the same time. The advice from the video Jess showed us on Thursday really helped. 

Thank you!

- Project 1: Finish on Completing the overall feel for the site in terms of the index/ home page. Then work on the other pages. Main Layout for website was developed. I was working on an original concept but then decided to scratch it due to the fact I could not get the nav bar to show with that format.
- Build on the foundations from the previous homework, and add bootstrap layouts to it.
- Project 2: Create the user responsive aspect to the web pages.
