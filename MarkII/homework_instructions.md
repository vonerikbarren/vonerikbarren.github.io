# Homework Instructions

\\ ~ My personal thoughts:

We worked on this file early to improve it, but we must do better, we need to dedicate time specifically for homework everyday leading to Saturday. So by saturday evening we are focusing on touch ups and more finalizing thoughts and learning rather than still workin on the project. 


\\ ~ Actual assignment - Part One - Bootstrap resdign on original website:

    [] Inside your Bootstrap-Portfolio repo, create index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html.


    [] Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:


        [] 1. A navbar


        [] 2. A responsive layout (remember the grid, rows and columns are your friends)

            - eg. On an xs screen, content should take up the entire screen. On sm and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right side of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device versus your computer to see this in action!



        [] Responsive images


        BONUS
        [] Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on your portfolio site (Hint: Check out the Bootstrap documentation)


        [] 3. Your Bootstrap solution should minimize use of media queries.


        [] 4. Deploy your new Bootstrap-powered portfolio to GitHub Pages.

\\ ~ Actual assignment - Part Two - Making original site mobile responsive:

> Copied & Pasted Instructions from GitLab with Personal Edits:

## Assignment Two Instructions - (No Bootstrap)


        [] 1. Copy the contents of Basic-Portfolio (your first homework solution) and paste the mentioned files into Responsive-Portfolio.

        [] 2. Note: Be sure not to include any dot files (e.g. .git, .gitignore) from the Basic-Portfolio repo.

        [] 3. If you chose the Wireframe exercise for your first homework assignment, talk to a TA, who will provide you with a template for your portfolio.

        [] 4. Inside your Responsive-Portfolio folder, find your styles.css file. You will write your media queries at the bottom of styles.css.

        [] 5. Use three @media screen tags, each with one of these max-widths: 980px, 768px and 640px.


            - [] You use 980px because you never want any of the content to be cut off. Since the desktop layout is about 960px wide, you want the media queries to kick in before your content gets cut off.
  
            - [] 768px is about the width of a tablet and 640px is about the width of a phone in landscape.




        [] 6. Make the layout match the following screenshots:


            index.html: 980px, 768px, 640px

            portfolio.html: 980px, 768px, 640px

            contact.html: 980px, 768px, 640px




        [] 7. Make the position of the header static (the default positioning) when the screen is 640px wide. The header design takes up a lot of room; you don't want it to stick to the top of a small screen and leave no room for the rest of your site.


        [] 8. Be sure to include the viewport tag in all your HTML files, otherwise your media-queries won't function as expected on mobile devices. (Hint: You won't need to use exact pixels for anything other than the container)


        [] 9. Protip: Use the Chrome extensions Window Resizer and Browser Width to see the browser dimensions in Chrome.


        [] 10. Deploy your new portfolio (now with media queries!) to GitHub Pages.
